## About the project

Mapping, GIS is my passion. I like to interconnect valuable data, assets, people with places, make them visually clear and precise. 2024 was the year of my introduction into this area, I tried some
maps services and libs, and this project is my summary portfolio (but still not all of my projects are included here).  Now I'm looking for possibilities to get involved in commercial geospatial services, especially
with vector base maps.
